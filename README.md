# Reverse-Sizing-MESSENGER-MErcury-Surface-Space-ENvironment-GEochemistry-and-Ranging

Messenger was launched successfully by a Delta II 7925H-9.5 rocket on August 3, 2004. The cruise phase of
the mission is 6.6 years in duration and includes six planetary flybys—one of Earth, two of Venus, and three of
Mercury—as well as a number of propulsive corrections to the trajectory. At the spacecraft’s fourth encounter with
Mercury, orbit insertion was accomplished on March 18, 2011. The aim of the mission is investigating Mercury.

This project performs a reverse engineering study of the NASA’s MESSENGER mission. Analizing all the spacecraft subsystems through preliminary quantitative analysis, with the aim of understanding the rationale behind the choices made by NASA engineers.
